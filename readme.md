# Nginx Load Balancer with Go Backend

This project demonstrates the implementation of a load balancer using Nginx with a Go backend service. The setup uses Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling.

## Features

- Load balancing across multiple Go backend instances
- Docker-based deployment
- Configurable load balancing algorithms
- Health checks for backend servers
- Easy scaling of backend services
- Containerized environment

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Docker and Nginx configuration

## Project Structure

```

├── docker-compose.yml    # Docker Compose configuration
├── nginx/               # Nginx configuration
│   └── nginx.conf      # Main Nginx configuration
└── backend/            # Go backend service

    └── go.sum         # Go dependencies checksum
```

## Configuration

The project is configured through the following files:

1. `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services and their relationships:
   - Nginx load balancer service
   - Go backend service
   - Network configuration
   - Volume mappings

2. `nginx/nginx.conf`: Contains the Nginx configuration:
   - Load balancing settings
   - Upstream server definitions
   - Proxy settings

3. `backend/`: Contains the Go application:
   - Main application code
   - Configuration files
   - Dockerfile for building the backend service

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nginx-go.git
   cd nginx-go
   ```

2. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. To scale the backend service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --scale backend=3
   ```

## Configuration Example

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    expose:
      - "8080"
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- View container logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```

- Check container status:
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

- Scale services:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --scale backend=3
  ```

## Security Considerations

- Keep Docker images updated
- Implement proper network security in Docker Compose
- Use secure headers in Nginx configuration
- Implement rate limiting
- Regular security audits
